Adventures in Python

Python is the fourth programming language that I will have learned. 

This is a record of all my programming work in Python for personal use.

You are free to review, share or modify the code as you please.

All code is written using Visual Studio Code on my 2017 MacBook Pro and Python 3.8.0 64-bit.

ENJOY!
